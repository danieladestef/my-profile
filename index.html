	Hi, I am a Venezuelan-Italian girl, now established in Lille, France for my university studies. I enjoy travelling, reading, the sea and spending time with my close friends. I love to learn about new things so I took a web design course and this is my first project! To create this website I used HTML and CCS coding only. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did learning 🤩

		<h2> Work, Internships and Experiences 💼</h2>
			<div >
			<h3>Firms I have worked with</h3>
				<p>
				The most recent job I have got was being a part-time Specialist (salesperson) at the <strong>Apple Store</strong> in Lille, France. Before that, I was doing a sales internship at <strong>The Kooples Store</strong> (always in my adopted city). For my first university internship, I worked as a shop assistant at <strong>Ewald Bosch GmbH - Gouda Käsehaus</strong> in Emmerich am Rhein, Germany and when I was in high school, I discovered the world of business in <strong>L'Oréal Venezuela.</strong> 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Experiences</h3>
				<p>
				As a student at IÉSEG, I proudly integrated <strong>The International Club</strong>. The school's association in charge of welcoming and guiding exchange and international students present in the Lille campus during their stay. <strong> I was an event planner</strong>, which means I was part of the team that organized 15 events for more than 500 students each semester. 🌎	
				</p>
				<p>
				<strong> My academic exchange</strong> is one of the most enriching experiences of my life. <strong>I completely immersed in a foreign country with a previously unknown culture to me.</strong> I was able to travel South Korea, meet students and professors, try out new foods, learn to read hangul (the Korean alphabet) as well as the basics of the Korean language and many more things! My personal goal of this exchange was <strong>to challenge myself to adapt in an environment where nothing was familiar</strong> and grow from this experience. I can happily say I overcame the obstacles on the road and <strong>successfully completed the challenge!</strong> 🏅
				</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Experiences continue here 👇🏼</h3>
				<p>
				When in middle school, I discovered <strong>EXPLO, a summer program that allows the young to explore their passions and themselves.</strong> I participated two times in the summer program, once in Wellesley College, MA</strong> and later in Yale University, CT.</srong>I met kids from around the world and grew independent from my family</strong>. I also <strong>improved my English</strong> and discovered I did not want to be a doctor but instead, found the  Economics course to much more intresting!
				<p/>
				<p>
				My parents love to travel and have passed on this passion to me. <strong>I traveled quite often</strong> growing up and was constantly exposed <strong>to different cultures, different people and different landscapes.</strong>  ✈️
				<br>
				Some countries I have visited: Japan, Spain, Russia, USA, England, Colombia, Germany, Panama, Italy, Aruba, Hungary, South Korea, Hong Kong, The Netherlands, Portugal, etc.

			<div>
			<p>
			These are some of my favorite places, books, food, films in the world. Feel free to click on the links to find out what the ✨ magic ✨ is about.
			</p>
				<p>
				These <strong>locations</strong> I have visited many times or during a long period and I always find them magical, these are my recommendations:
				<br>
				🚤  If you happen to visit Italy during the summer, you can't miss these beautiful places, all close to each other: <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/campania/positano" target="_blank" >Positano</a>, <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/campania/ravello" target="_blank">Ravello</a> and <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/campania/capri" target="_blank">Capri Island</a>. 
				<br>
				🏝  If you are looking for dreamy white sand beaches and the kindest people, visit <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/aruba-bonaire-and-curacao/aruba" target="_blank">Aruba</a> !
				<br>
				🌃	Three cities you should experience, not visit like a tourist: the oh-so-famous <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-york-city" target="_blank">New York City</a>, the always eclectic <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/england/london" target="_blank">London</a> and for the perfect mix of past and future, take a trip far east to <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/south-korea/seoul" target="_blank">Seoul</a> !
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
				These <strong>books</strong> marked me in their own way. I can't ensure you will like them but they are worth considering.
				<br>
				📚 <em>The Little Prince</em> <a href="https://livre.fnac.com/a1956006/Le-Petit-Prince-Le-Petit-Prince-Antoine-de-Saint-Exupery" target="_blank"><em>(Le Petit Prince)</em></a> by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
				<br>
				📚 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38447.The_Handmaid_s_Tale" target="_blank"><em>The Handmaid's Tale</em></a> by Margaret Atwood
				<br>
				📚	<em>The Time in Between</em> <a href="https://www.planetadelibros.com/libro-el-tiempo-entre-costuras/269163" target="_blank"><em>(El tiempo entre costuras)</em></a> by Maria Dueñas
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p> 
				Let's talk about serious things: <strong>food!</strong>
				<br>
				😋  A typical french food that hardly any international knows about: "Rillettes d'Oie". Don't ask what it is but instead try it!
				<br>
				😋 If you ever go to southern Italy, ask for "Calamari Fritti" (Calamar rings fried) and "Parmigiana" (a cousin of the lasagna but way yummier and vegetarian friendly)
				<br>
				😋  An ingredient I discovered in South Korea and that I have loved since: Taro  💜 I personally recommend Taro Bubble Tea. 
				<br>
				😋  If you ever visit a chinese restaurant: order "Shrimp Siu Mai" 🦐  you can't go wrong with this.
				<br>
				😋  For the Japanese food fans, twist things-up with a "Donkatsu" or "Unadon" (there is so much more than sushi and sashimi!). Be careful, the Donkatsu I recommend is the authentic japanese-style, there are many versions out there...
				<br>
				😋  Last but not least, if you have never eaten Korean food, two dishes you should definitely try: "Sundubu-jjigae" (Tofu stew) and "Pajeon"!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
				🎥  Two must-see films if you like <strong>thriller movies</strong> : <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130884/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank" ><em>Shutter Island</em></a>  by Martin Scorsese and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4857264/" target="_blank" ><em>The Invisible Guest (Contratiempo)</em></a> by Oriol Paulo.
				<br>
				🎥  You NEED to watch these <strong>rom-com movies</strong> at least once in your life: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120148/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank" ><em>Sliding Doors</em></a>  by Peter Howitt and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0251127/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_5" target="_blank"><em>How to Lose a Guy in 10 days</em></a>  by Donald Petrie.

				Thank me later for these 😌

			<p>
			Soft Skills are important in work and life in general, but what about personality traits? I think having the right attitude is half of the recipe, so here are some ingredients for a "Daniela" full-course meal 🍽.
			<br>
			Empathetic(25%)........Too much for her own good
			<br>
			Responsible(20%).......Slight tendency to overload herself
			<br>
			Driven(15%).................Also a little impatient 
			<br>
			Curious(15%)...............Everything is "SO interesting"
			<br>
			Considerate(10%).......Will judge if you are not at least a little bit considerate
			<br>
			Friendly(10%)...............Don't let the low percentage fool you, this is a strong ingredient
			<br>
			Loyal(5%)......................Life-long kind of loyalty

		<h2>  My Tool Box 🗃 </h2>
			<div>
			<h3>"Excuse my French"</h3>
				<p>
				I love learning a language! This is why I speak 4 different languages fluently (Spanish, French, English and Italian) and have basic language skills in Korean (I am constantly working to improve my Korean 😉 )
			</div>
			<div>
			<h3>IT stands for "I'm Trying"</h3>
				Daily and experienced use of Microsoft Package (Word, Excel and Power Point)
				<br>Also, I have taken courses and know a fair amount in IBM SPSS 7 and Tableau. When I am not busy, I am an assiduous user of Canva and iMovie. 🎥
				<br>Moreover, took some basic courses of SQL and Python but did not quite like it (even if it is learning a new language 😝 ).
			</div>
			<div>
			<h3>Soft (like a ☁️) Skills</h3>
				My studies, professional and associative experiences have brought me many soft skills but here are my favorite ones 😍 :
				<br>
				Flexibility | Time Management | Problem Solving | Decisiveness | Multitasking
